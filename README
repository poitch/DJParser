Dumb JSON Parser (DJParser) is a very simple Objective-C (Cocoa) JSON parser, implemented using NSScanner.

It is not designed to be fast or efficient, but designed to be dropped in an iPhone or Mac application and ready to go. Setting up other JSON parsers for combined iPhone/Cocoa applications is usually complex, and that is the problem that DJParser is trying to solve.

Add the 2 files DJParser.m and DJParser.h in your project, then call 
NSDictionary *resp = [DJParser parse: myString];

The parse function returns an object (NSArray, NSDictionary, NSString...)

This parser should be good for quick prototyping and API with small payloads.
